This project explores how aging populations, healthcare access, and care quality interact to shape health outcomes across U.S. states. Using state-level datasets from CDC, CMS, and HIFLD, we analyze patterns linking the density of healthcare facilities, nursing home quality ratings, and self-reported physical and mental health.
The findings show that quality—not merely access—plays the decisive role in improving population health, especially for older adults.
Through data cleaning, visualization (heatmaps, regression, and regional comparisons), and cross-metric analysis, the study provides actionable insights into how structural factors and management performance drive health disparities across regions.
